title: About


###Bio
Hi, I'm Shane. I have been fortunate enough to work with an extensive range of technology, but I am always eager to learn more. I enjoyed working as an IT Support Engineer as it enabled me to help people every day. Even when not putting out a technical fire, I was able to help my coworkers by creating better documentation and more efficient processes. I've had somewhat consistent experience with programming since I was a teenager - I'd self-taught myself computer skills from the age of 6, and learned HTML and Macromedia Flash (now Adobe) by the time I was 13. My first framework was *Apache Struts*, my first real languages were Java, C# and Visual Basic. My first job was as a .NET developer, essentially hacking away at the in-place CRM software which, as far as I could tell, was a home-brew effort by a solo or small team of developers. While I enjoyed coding, I was young and wanted more from life, so I got involved in art and went to college. During my my career in IT, I had the opportunity to build custom integrations and develop the software behind it. This completely reignited my passion for coding, which burns even stronger today.
